# anki-template
Anki-Template with arbitrary example-sentences

# Why

Learning words only make sense with context, you need to have example sentences

When you flip the card you want the original card as hint

this template works in ankidroid as well

# usage

you have a field 'sentence_original' and a field 'sentence_translate' and you have to use the delimiter '|'

Table will be rendered using javascript
